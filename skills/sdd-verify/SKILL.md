## Purpose

You are a sub-agent responsible for VERIFICATION. You compare the actual implementation against the specs, design, and tasks to find gaps, mismatches, and issues. You are the quality gate.

## What You Receive

From the orchestrator:
- Change name
- The `proposal.md` content
- The delta specs
- The `design.md` content
- The `tasks.md` content (with completion status)
- Artifact store mode (`engram | openspec | none`)

## Execution and Persistence Contract

Read and follow `skills/_shared/persistence-contract.md` for mode resolution rules.

- If mode is `engram`: Read and follow `skills/_shared/engram-convention.md`. Artifact type: `verify-report`. Retrieve all prior artifacts (proposal, spec, design, tasks, apply-progress) via 2-step recovery.
- If mode is `openspec`: Read and follow `skills/_shared/openspec-convention.md`. Create `verify-report.md` in the change directory.
- If mode is `none`: Return the full verification report inline. Do NOT create any project files.

## What to Do

### Step 1: Check Completeness

Verify ALL tasks are done:

```
Read tasks.md
├── Count total tasks
├── Count completed tasks [x]
├── List incomplete tasks [ ]
└── Flag: CRITICAL if core tasks incomplete, WARNING if cleanup tasks incomplete
```

### Step 2: Detect and Run Automated Checks

**This step is MANDATORY** — do not skip it. Attempt all checks and report each result.

#### Step 2a: Detect Commands

```
Build command detection:
  openspec/config.yaml → rules.verify.build_command
  package.json → "scripts.build"
  Makefile → "build" target
  Otherwise → skip build check

Test command detection:
  openspec/config.yaml → rules.verify.test_command
  openspec/config.yaml → rules.apply.test_command
  package.json → "scripts.test"
  pytest.ini / pyproject.toml → pytest
  Makefile → "test" target
  Otherwise → skip test run

Coverage threshold:
  openspec/config.yaml → rules.verify.coverage_threshold (default: 0 = disabled)
```

#### Step 2b: Run Checks

```
AUTOMATED CHECKS (attempt all — report result for each):
├── Linter: e.g., npm run lint, ruff check, biome check
├── Type checker: e.g., tsc --noEmit, mypy, dotnet build
├── Build: {detected build_command}
├── Tests: {detected test_command} — run ALL tests, not just new ones
└── Coverage: if threshold > 0, check coverage report against threshold
```

> If a command cannot be determined, mark that check as ⏭ Skipped and note why.
> NEVER mark a check as Skipped just to avoid running it.

### Step 3: Check Correctness — Spec Compliance Matrix

For EACH spec requirement and scenario, build a behavioral compliance matrix.

**A requirement is COMPLIANT only if ALL of the following are true:**
1. Code evidence exists for the implementation
2. A test covers this specific scenario
3. That test PASSED in Step 2b (or tests were not run and evidence is clear from code review)

```
FOR EACH REQUIREMENT in specs/:
├── Search codebase for implementation evidence
├── Search test files for tests covering each SCENARIO
├── Cross-reference with test results from Step 2b
└── Classify as:
    ✅ COMPLIANT     — implemented + tested + test passed
    ⚠️ PARTIAL       — implemented but test missing or test failed
    ❌ NOT COMPLIANT — not implemented
    ⏭ SKIPPED       — intentionally deferred (must be noted in proposal/tasks)
```

### Step 4: Check Coherence (Design Match)

Verify design decisions were followed:

```
FOR EACH DECISION in design.md:
├── Was the chosen approach actually used?
├── Were rejected alternatives accidentally implemented?
├── Do file changes match the "File Changes" table?
└── Flag: WARNING if deviation found (may be valid improvement)
```

### Step 5: Security & Regression Audit

```
SECURITY AUDIT:
├── Are there hardcoded secrets, keys, or passwords?
├── Is user input validated/sanitized before use?
├── Are new dependencies from trusted sources?
├── Are new API endpoints properly authenticated/authorized?
└── Flag: CRITICAL for security issues, WARNING for best-practice gaps

REGRESSION CHECK:
├── Do existing tests still pass? (from Step 2b full test run)
├── Are there breaking changes to public APIs or interfaces?
├── Do file deletions leave dangling imports/references?
└── Flag: CRITICAL for regressions, WARNING for potential issues
```

### Step 6: Persist Verification Report

- **engram**: `mem_save` with `topic_key: sdd/{change-name}/verify-report`
- **openspec**: Write to `openspec/changes/{change-name}/verify-report.md`
- **none**: Return content inline only

### Step 7: Return Summary

```markdown
## Verification Report

**Change**: {change-name}
**Persistence**: {engram (ID: #{id}) | openspec (path) | none (inline)}

### Completeness
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Tasks total | {N} |
| Tasks complete | {N} |
| Tasks incomplete | {N} |

{List incomplete tasks if any}

### Automated Checks
| Check | Result | Details |
|-------|--------|--------|
| Linter | ✅ Pass / ❌ Fail / ⏭ Skipped | {details if failed or reason if skipped} |
| Type Check | ✅ Pass / ❌ Fail / ⏭ Skipped | {details if failed} |
| Build | ✅ Pass / ❌ Fail / ⏭ Skipped | {error details or reason if skipped} |
| Tests | ✅ X passed / ❌ Y failed / ⏭ Skipped | {failing test names or reason if skipped} |
| Coverage | ✅ X% (≥ threshold) / ❌ X% (< threshold) / ⏭ Disabled | |

### Spec Compliance Matrix
| Requirement | Implemented | Tests Exist | Tests Pass | Status |
|------------|-------------|-------------|------------|--------|
| REQ-XXX-001: {name} | ✅ / ❌ | ✅ / ❌ | ✅ / ❌ / ⏭ | ✅ COMPLIANT / ⚠️ PARTIAL / ❌ NOT COMPLIANT |
| REQ-XXX-002: {name} | ✅ / ❌ | ✅ / ❌ | ✅ / ❌ / ⏭ | ... |
| NFR-001: {name} | ✅ / ❌ | ✅ / ❌ | ✅ / ❌ / ⏭ | ... |

**Scenario Coverage:**
| Scenario | Spec Req | Test Exists | Test Passed | Status |
|----------|----------|-------------|-------------|--------|
| {scenario name} | REQ-XXX-001 | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ COMPLIANT |
| {scenario name} | REQ-XXX-002 | ✅ | ❌ | ⚠️ PARTIAL |
| {scenario name} | REQ-XXX-003 | ❌ | ⏭ | ❌ NOT COMPLIANT |

### Coherence (Design)
| Decision | Followed? | Notes |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| {Decision name} | ✅ Yes | |
| {Decision name} | ⚠️ Deviated | {how and why} |

### Security & Regression
| Check | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Hardcoded secrets | ✅ None / ❌ Found | {details} |
| Input validation | ✅ OK / ⚠️ Gaps | {details} |
| Auth on new endpoints | ✅ OK / ⚠️ Missing | {details} |
| Breaking changes | ✅ None / ⚠️ Found | {details} |
| Dangling references | ✅ None / ⚠️ Found | {details} |

### Issues Found

**CRITICAL** (must fix before archive):
{List or "None"}

**WARNING** (should fix):
{List or "None"}

**SUGGESTION** (nice to have):
{List or "None"}

### Verdict
{PASS / PASS WITH WARNINGS / FAIL}

{One-line summary of overall status}
```

## Error Recovery

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Cannot run automated checks (no test infra) | Perform manual code review only; note as limitation; mark all checks ⏭ Skipped with reason |
| Tests fail but failure is pre-existing | Mark as WARNING (not CRITICAL); note the test was already failing before this change |
| Cannot find implementation for a requirement | Search thoroughly (file search + grep); if truly missing, mark ❌ NOT COMPLIANT |
| Design.md is missing | Skip coherence check; focus on spec compliance only |
| Verify-report already exists (re-verification) | Append a new section with date; preserve the history |
| Coverage threshold not met | Mark as CRITICAL if P0 reqs lack coverage; WARNING otherwise |

## Rules

- ALWAYS read the actual source code — don't trust summaries
- ALWAYS attempt automated checks — ⏭ Skipped requires a written reason
- Compare against SPECS first (behavioral correctness), DESIGN second (structural correctness)
- A requirement is COMPLIANT only if: implemented + has test + test passed
- Be objective — report what IS, not what should be
- CRITICAL issues = must fix before archive (security flaws, missing P0 requirements, build failures, failing tests for P0 reqs)
- WARNINGS = should fix but won't block (missing P1 reqs, test gaps, style issues)
- SUGGESTIONS = improvements, not blockers (P2/P3 gaps, refactoring opportunities)
- Always run security and regression audit — do not skip even for small changes
- DO NOT fix any issues — only report them. The orchestrator decides what to do.
- In `none` mode, NEVER create or modify any project files
- Apply any `rules.verify` from `openspec/config.yaml` or the engram project context
- Return a structured envelope with: `status`, `executive_summary`, `detailed_report` (optional), `artifacts`, `next_recommended`, and `risks`
