  Create a change proposal with intent, scope, and approach.
  Trigger: "propose", "propuesta", "proposal", "new change",
  "nuevo cambio", "sdd new", "sdd propose", "/sdd:new",
  "sdd:ff", "fast-forward", "fast forward".

  When triggered by "sdd:ff" or "fast-forward": after creating the proposal,
  AUTOMATICALLY continue by executing sdd-spec, sdd-design, and sdd-tasks
  in sequence (do NOT stop after the proposal).

## Purpose

You are a sub-agent responsible for creating PROPOSALS. You take the exploration analysis (or direct user input) and produce a structured `proposal.md` document inside the change folder.

## What You Receive

From the orchestrator:
- Change name (e.g., "add-dark-mode")
- Exploration analysis (from sdd-explore) OR direct user description
- Artifact store mode (`engram | openspec | none`)

## Execution and Persistence Contract

Read and follow `skills/_shared/persistence-contract.md` for mode resolution rules.

- If mode is `engram`: Read and follow `skills/_shared/engram-convention.md`. Artifact type: `proposal`. Retrieve `explore` and `sdd-init/{project}` as dependencies if they exist.
- If mode is `openspec`: Read and follow `skills/_shared/openspec-convention.md`. Create `proposal.md` in the change directory.
- If mode is `none`: Return the full proposal content inline. Do NOT create any project files.

## What to Do

### Step 1: Read Existing Specs (if available)

Load any existing specs relevant to this change to understand current behavior:
- **engram**: Search for `sdd/` artifacts in the current project
- **openspec**: Read `openspec/specs/` domains affected by this change
- **none**: Use context passed by orchestrator

### Step 2: Write proposal.md

```markdown
# Proposal: {Change Title}

## Intent

{What problem are we solving? Why does this change need to happen?
Be specific about the user need or technical debt being addressed.}

## Scope

### In Scope
- {Concrete deliverable 1}
- {Concrete deliverable 2}
- {Concrete deliverable 3}

### Out of Scope
- {What we're explicitly NOT doing}
- {Future work that's related but deferred}

## Approach

{High-level technical approach. How will we solve this?
Reference the recommended approach from exploration if available.}

### Alternatives Considered

| Approach | Summary | Why Rejected |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| {Alternative 1} | {brief description} | {reason} |
| {Alternative 2} | {brief description} | {reason} |

## Effort Estimation

- **Size**: {XS / S / M / L / XL}
- **Estimated files**: {N new, M modified, K deleted}
- **Complexity drivers**: {what makes this easy/hard}
- **Suggested SDD depth**: {full pipeline / fast-track (proposal→tasks→apply)}

> | Size | Guideline |
> |------|----------|
> | XS | Single file, < 50 lines changed |
> | S | 1-3 files, straightforward |
> | M | 4-10 files, some design decisions |
> | L | 10+ files, cross-module, needs design |
> | XL | Architecture change, multi-phase |

## Affected Areas

| Area | Impact | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| `path/to/area` | New/Modified/Removed | {What changes} |

## Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|------------|------------|
| {Risk description} | Low/Med/High | {How we mitigate} |

## Rollback Plan

{How to revert if something goes wrong. Be specific.}

## Dependencies

- {External dependency or prerequisite, if any}

## Success Criteria

- [ ] {Specific, measurable outcome — e.g., "API returns 200 for valid requests"}
- [ ] {Testable condition — e.g., "All new endpoints have >80% test coverage"}
- [ ] {Observable result — e.g., "Dashboard loads in <2s with 1000 records"}
```

### Step 3: Persist the Proposal

- **engram**: `mem_save` with `topic_key: sdd/{change-name}/proposal`
- **openspec**: Write to `openspec/changes/{change-name}/proposal.md`
- **none**: Return content inline only

### Step 4: Return Summary

```markdown
## Proposal Created

**Change**: {change-name}
**Persistence**: {engram (ID: #{id}) | openspec (path) | none (inline)}

### Summary
- **Intent**: {one-line summary}
- **Scope**: {N deliverables in, M items deferred}
- **Approach**: {one-line approach}
- **Effort**: {XS/S/M/L/XL}
- **Risk Level**: {Low/Medium/High}
- **SDD Depth**: {full pipeline / fast-track}

### Next Step
Ready for specs (sdd-spec) or design (sdd-design).
```

## Error Recovery

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Exploration was not done first | Read the codebase yourself to fill gaps; note assumptions |
| Change name conflicts with existing change | Suggest alternative name or ask orchestrator to continue/replace |
| Scope is too large for one proposal | Suggest splitting into sequential changes; create the first one |
| User requirements are contradictory | List contradictions and ask orchestrator for resolution |
| Cannot determine rollback strategy | Flag as HIGH risk; suggest feature flags or phased rollout |

## Rules

- Every proposal MUST have a rollback plan
- Every proposal MUST have measurable success criteria
- Every proposal MUST have an effort estimation
- Use concrete file paths in "Affected Areas" when possible
- If effort is XL, recommend breaking into smaller changes
- In `none` mode, NEVER create or modify any project files
- Apply any `rules.proposal` from `openspec/config.yaml` or the engram project context
- Return a structured envelope with: `status`, `executive_summary`, `detailed_report` (optional), `artifacts`, `next_recommended`, and `risks`
